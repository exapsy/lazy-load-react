# Lazy Load

## Functionality

Loads a series of images in the following order

- **Placeholder image**: If you have 100 products in one page, you dont wanna load 100 low resolution images, but 1 placeholder image for all of them instead
- Low resolution image: Loads this first in a blurry form before high resolution
- High resolution image
